/**
 *
 * @description
 * A helper for normalizing focus behavior across browsers.
 *
 * A browsers default focus behavior (eg `element.focus()`) will scroll an element into
 * view if it's not already visible within it's scroll-parent. However, the HTML standard
 * allows for an option of `preventScroll` that allows the user to customize this behavior. This method
 * normalizes this behavior across all browsers.
 *
 *  @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus#Browser_compatibility
 * `IE11` does NOT support this option.
 *
 *
 * @see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ms536738(v=vs.94)
 * However, `IE11` supports a method called `setActive` which does provides a way to focus an element without scrolling it into view.
